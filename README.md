# PETfold-container
This repository contains a Singularity container for:

- **PETfold** (version 2.2?) performs Probabilistic Evolutionary and Thermodynamic folding of a multiple alignment of RNA sequences.
- **PETcofold** (verison 3.3?) is an integrated framework with PETfold to fold and search for RNA-RNA interactions between two multiple alignments of RNA sequences.

When using these tools, please cite:
